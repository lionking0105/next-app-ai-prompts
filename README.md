# About

The project was implemented in order to learn the **Next JS** framework, understand the skills of development and deployment of fullstack applications, user authentication and application interaction with the MongoDB database.

This is based on the **JavaScript Mastery** tutorial video, which used Next 13. I had to update the project to the latest Next 14.1 version myself.

The implementation on the Next framework made it possible to make a modern and very fast site. PageSpeed Insights results:
